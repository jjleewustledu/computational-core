Welcome to the documentation for Computational Core
===================================================

**computational-core** describes software projects written by John J. Lee for the `Computational Core of the Neuroimaging Laboratories at Washington University in Saint Louis <https://sites.wustl.edu/nillabs/nil-core-services/>`_.  These projects support neuroimaging research involving biophysical models of brain metabolism and function; instrumentation for positron emission tomography, resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging, and electrocorticography; data archives based on `XNAT <https://www.xnat.org/>`_; data formats such as `4dfp <https://4dfp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_, `NIfTI <https://nifti.nimh.nih.gov/nifti-2>`_, `CIFTI <https://www.nitrc.org/projects/cifti/>`_, and `BIDS <https://bids.neuroimaging.io/>`_; and inferential methodologies from Bayesian statistics and machine learning.
